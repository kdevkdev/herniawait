# herniawait

Example ioslide presentation with some animated plotly graphs created with R markdown. Data is not published for privacy reasons. 

Numbers are not necessarily representative either and baseed on old data (2004 and 2005 from Swedish inguinal hernia register). 

The goal is merely to demonstrate how one could go about creating fancy rmarkdown presentations.
