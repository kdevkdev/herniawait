Example ioslide presentation with some animated plotly graphs created with R markdown. Data is not published for privacy reasons. 

Numbers are not necessarily representative either and baseed on old data (2004 and 2005, inguinal hernia from Swedish hernia register). 

The goal is merely to demonstrate how one could create fancy rmarkdown presentations.
